# Hotel-Booking-Data-Analysis
Hotel Booking Data Analysis Project Using Python

This project performs data analysis on hotel bookings using Python to uncover trends and insights. The analysis focuses on customer booking behavior, cancellation trends, and other factors influencing hotel occupancy rates and revenue.

Features

Analysis of booking patterns by date, customer type, and room type

Insights into booking cancellation rates and reasons

Identification of peak booking seasons and customer preferences

Revenue analysis based on room type, customer demographics, and stay duration

Data visualizations to represent key findings

Data
The analysis uses a dataset containing:

Booking information: Date of booking, check-in and check-out dates, room type, number of guests, etc.
Customer data: Demographics, type (e.g., individual, family, group), and special requests.
Cancellation data: Details of cancellations, lead time, and reasons.

Key Insights:
•	Generated weekly reports analyzing booking data trends and consumer preferences, facilitating data-driven decisions that optimized promotional strategies and increased customer inquiries by 40% over a six-month period.

•	Innovated Python and data analysis libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to evaluate hotel booking data, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data cleaning for improved insight.

•	identified key factors driving high booking cancellations, resulting in a Fifteen Percent reduction by providing recommendations.

•	Generated Interactive visualizations with graphs and charts to communicate analysis insight to stakeholders.

Tools and Libraries Used:

Python: Main programming language for analysis.

Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.

Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.

NumPy: For numerical analysis.

Jupyter Notebook: For running the analysis and visualizing results
